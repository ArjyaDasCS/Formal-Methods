The chosen array size is 5. How ever, each element of the array is symbolic (not constant). The argument to the function
'sort' and 'checkSorted' is 'con', however originally in 'main' the elements are declared as 'symbolic'. So, it's actually like
the running of symbolic execution from behind. For, the array size 5, clearly function 'sort' is working as the assertion is 
passed for all the array elements and no error is detected. Here, JPF tries all possible values(within the max and min range) for each
element of the array to validate the sorting process. Length of the array is not a factor here as for length 5 if the process is
working for all symbolic elements then for any variable length (n) array, this process will also work as during the checking process
we are working with symbolic values not any specific concrete values. That's why this can be considered as exhaustive testing of the sort method.
